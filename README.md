# sharpEEEform
Experimental C# form generator

I tried to do this in Python initially but I ran into three issues.

1. PDF generation turned out to be too annoying
2. the GUI was too clunky
3. I couldn't reduce the compilation to a small file size

so I decided to recreate it in C#. So far, it has delivered better results. PDF file is decent, the GUI is great and the zipped folder is tiny.
